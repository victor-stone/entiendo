TODO

- ~<del>Session list</del>~:
  - ~~Show when session is available~~
  - s~~ort 'due' sessions above~~
- Allow multiple tones (this is pratically a ground up rewrite lol)
- ~~Make sure new sessions are unique~~
- add region everywhere
- ~~prove that 'trivial' is really working~~
- do bookmarks
- ~~do "Due" session~~
- ~~add description to tones~~
- do through test suite of SIRP
- feature: 'get recommendation' for picking a category
- all the UI shit
  - standardize error/prompts
  - ~~sexy landing page~~
- convert db to sql
- ~~Stats feature (below)~~
- what is "invalid or expired token"
- handle when home screen is Auto0 error'd out
- upload audio should check for duplicates
- (should probably prepare for having multiple audios for example)
- ~~change all 'category' to 'tone'~~
- ~~display cat and family when eval is don~~e
- for new idiom - should incorporate a picker to make sure it doesn't already exist
- lowercase of incoming idioms when not starting with !? before dupe check
- ~~Filter is ON/OFF~~
- ~~recast 'Filter'~~
- why 'fail' message after successful import csv
- ~~clear the exercise if you change the filter~~
- remove a exercise from my timeline (mark it as "seen but not heard" ?)
- finishing an exercise wipes the stats
- ~~deal with 'Continue' button (add a 'cancel' button that both disappear~~
  and then add another cancel button )~~
- feature: missed word session mode
- ~~new user default to 'Super Common'~~
- user sync is funky (not everything is merging on login)

API: getNumberOfTestsToday (countcreatedAt dates for last 24 hours of progress)
prevent 'get next' button after max new items is hit.

Two scenarios to cover better:
- The queue doesn't have any more filtered due
- 

error reporting page (straight to GitHub)

Settings:
- When to apply filters (tone and usage) 
--- only apply filters to new idioms
--- apply to all exercises
