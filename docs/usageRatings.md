Here’s a summary of the utility scale ("how common is an idiom, a usage meter) from 1 to 10, based on how we’ve been applying it:


Score	Summary
10	Extremely common, high-frequency expressions. Used constantly across all registers (e.g. tener que, estar bien, dar cuenta). Found in everyday talk, media, education.
9	Very common, but not automatic. Used frequently in casual or general speech. Familiar to nearly all native speakers.
8	General-use phrases, neutral tone, and common in conversation and writing. Not slangy, but broadly understood.
7	Moderately common. You’ll hear them regularly but not daily. Known to most, but may require more context or be situational.
6	Recognizable, but informal or limited to certain groups. May be casual, idiomatic, or regional without being obscure.
5	Known idioms with narrower use, like proverbs or formal sayings (al pan pan…, etc.). Understandable but less used in modern, spontaneous speech.
4	Occasional, less common expressions. Might appear in scripted dialogue, literature, or old-school idiom books.
3	Rare or subcultural. Recognizable only if you’re familiar with specific groups or styles (e.g., youth slang, niche humor).
2	Esoteric, poetic, or highly local. Probably understood by natives but almost never said aloud unless in character or for effect.
1	Hyper-obscure. Possibly literary, old-fashioned, or overheard once in a film. Not practically useful for learners or general use.
