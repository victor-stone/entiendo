You can [chat with the bot](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-41cybo2Gw-entiendo) (running on OpenAI) with specific knowledge of this app to have a deeper conversation about idioms, parsing examples, etc. It does that pretty consistently well.

On the other hand, even though the bot knows exactly how the app works (it has full access to the source code) I, personally, would not trust it to be accurate about specifics regarding questions about how to do stuff with the app. Your mileage may vary.
