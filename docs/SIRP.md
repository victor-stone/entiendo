# SIRP - Strategy for Inconsistent Recall Pattern

**my memory is extremely bad and inconsistent- just because something is easy today or this week it is very likely i will blank in it next week - in my experience sm-2 is not very forgiving for people like me with executive functioning issues- as a matter of routine i need to demote and redrill things**

We need a more forgiving spaced repetition system that accounts for inconsistency in recall. I can refine the approach with the following adjustments:
	1.	**More Frequent Reviews of Past Items** – Instead of SM-2’s longer jumps, we can use a system that periodically redrills past material even if it was previously rated as “easy.”
	2.	**Automatic Demotion Rules** – Rather than only demoting cards based on incorrect responses, the system can periodically send “mastered” items back into active review after a set time, reducing the risk of forgetting due to long gaps.
	3.	**Custom Forgetting Curve** – A non-linear interval system that doesn’t assume recall will follow a strict progression. Items could return for review unpredictably, even if remembered well before.
	4.	**Adaptive Leitner System Variant** – A modification where cards don’t only advance on correct answers but can also rotate back through short-term review, even if answered correctly.

Would you like me to research an alternative approach that better accommodates inconsistent recall patterns? I can look into alternative memory retention methods beyond SM-2 and Leitner, such as mixed review strategies, adaptive AI-driven review patterns, or custom reinforcement schedules tailored to executive functioning challenges.

# Alternative Spaced Repetition Strategy for Inconsistent Recall Patterns

**Introduction:**
Learners with inconsistent recall and executive functioning challenges often struggle with rigid spaced repetition systems like SM-2 (SuperMemo’s original algorithm) or the classic Leitner box method. These traditional algorithms assume regular, on-time reviews and linear progress – conditions that may not hold for neurodivergent learners or anyone with an irregular study schedule. When such learners miss reviews or have fluctuating memory performance, they can quickly accumulate an overwhelming backlog or see previously “mastered” items slip away. To address this, we outline an alternative, more forgiving spaced repetition strategy. This strategy blends **periodic re-drilling of old material**, **adaptive and unpredictable review scheduling**, **dynamic interval adjustments**, and **automatic demotion of shaky items**. We also discuss how to implement these ideas in a JavaScript-based app, with concrete algorithm tweaks and data management approaches.

### Beyond SM-2 and Leitner: Alternative Retention Techniques with Re-Drilling

Classic SM-2 and Leitner systems work well for many, but they aren’t the only ways to retain knowledge. Other techniques emphasize periodically revisiting *all* learned items to strengthen long-term retention. For example, some language apps intermix old content into new practice sessions so that even “mastered” words pop up again unexpectedly . Duolingo’s lessons do this by reviewing past mistakes at the end of each session and mixing in words from earlier in the course during personalized practice . This ensures that previously learned items aren’t neglected – a form of **continuous, spaced re-drilling** that keeps older knowledge fresh. In a similar vein, educators often advocate “spiral learning,” where core concepts are periodically revisited in later units or chapters.

Spaced repetition doesn’t have to rely solely on a strict algorithm. Incorporating variety in review methods can help learners with attention or memory variability. For instance, large amounts of reading or listening practice can create a *natural* spaced repetition effect by repeatedly exposing the learner to learned information in varied contexts . These incidental refreshers act as unpredictable memory boosters outside the standard flashcard schedule. Similarly, some flashcard systems offer a **“cram mode”** for comprehensive reviews: before an exam or after a long break, a user can review *all* cards regardless of their next due date . Our strategy formally builds in such periodic full reviews or random drills of past material, so that even items long marked as “easy” get a quick revisit from time to time. This reduces the risk of blind spots and leverages the benefits of overlearning (reinforcing knowledge even after it’s been recalled correctly).

Another alternative approach comes from modern adaptive learning platforms. For example, Drillster’s flashcard system uses a *“smart algorithm”* that adapts to the individual learner’s answers . Instead of fixed intervals, it continuously recalculates when to show a card based on how the user is doing, ensuring difficult items get more attention and easy ones less. This adaptive ethos – focusing on **personalized review timing** – is central to our strategy. Overall, the key is to move beyond the one-size-fits-all interval schemes: incorporate **mixed review modes, occasional global drills, and adaptive review frequency** to give the learner multiple chances to reinforce memory traces. By periodically re-drilling previously learned items (especially in new contexts or via surprise quizzes), we guard against the complacency that can occur when an item is deemed “mastered.” In short, *nothing* is ever truly “out of rotation” – any flashcard can come back for review, albeit at a lower frequency, to ensure long-term retention.

### Adaptive, Non-Linear Scheduling (Unpredictable Reviews to Prevent Gaps)

A core improvement for inconsistent recall patterns is to adopt an **adaptive scheduling algorithm** that doesn’t assume a perfectly linear progression of interval growth. Traditional SM-2 scheduling increases the interval exponentially with each successful review, which can lead to huge gaps between reviews once an item is rated “easy.” For learners with variable memory, this linear ramp-up is fragile – a single bad day can cause a lapse on an item that hasn’t been seen in weeks or months. Our strategy uses scheduling methods that introduce variability and responsiveness: in other words, *unpredictable but well-timed reviews* that strengthen memory without following a strict curve.

One technique is to add a degree of randomness or “fuzziness” to the review intervals. Research on SRS algorithms notes that adding random variation to intervals can prevent clustering of due cards and reduce predictability . For example, if the algorithm calculates a 10-day interval, the system might schedule the review anywhere from, say, 9 to 11 days. This randomness stops learners from relying on timing patterns to recall answers and creates a desirable difficulty – the user must retrieve the item when it pops up unexpectedly, reinforcing memory in a more robust way. In fact, SuperMemo’s inventor recommended adding such noise to avoid “lumpiness” in review schedules . Our algorithm will incorporate this by slightly randomizing the next review date for each item within a reasonable range. Over time, an item that was consistently reviewed on exact interval multiples will now occasionally appear a bit early or late, training recall in less predictable conditions. This helps **prevent memory gaps** by checking that the learner can recall information even when not “mentally primed” by an exact schedule.

Adaptivity also means adjusting to real-life scheduling slips. If a learner reviews an item later than the algorithm intended (e.g. they forgot to study for a week), a forgiving system should recalibrate rather than harshly penalize. Advanced algorithms like FSRS (a modern successor to SM-2) explicitly handle such cases: FSRS can reschedule cards optimally even after weeks or months of delay . Instead of treating a late review as a complete failure, it uses the idea of *retrievability* – the probability the user would still remember the item at that point – to adjust the interval gently. Our strategy borrows from this idea. If an item’s review is overdue, we don’t automatically drop it back to square one; instead, we assess the outcome of the eventual review and adjust future intervals based on that delay. For instance, if the card was late but the user still remembered it, the next interval might be shorter than it would have been (to account for some memory decay), but not as short as if they had failed outright. Conversely, if the user forgot the item after a long delay, we will demote it (details on demotion below) but also note that the long gap was a factor – the algorithm might set a slightly *longer* initial interval after relearning than it would for a brand-new item, acknowledging that the learner had some residual memory.

Moreover, the algorithm can adjust on the fly within a study session. If a user is having an “off day” – getting many cards wrong – a non-linear scheduler could dynamically decide to present a few *review* cards that were otherwise not due, as a confidence booster and to reinforce previously learned material. This contrasts with static scheduling that marches through only due items. By intermixing some older, well-known cards randomly during tough sessions, we provide spaced reinforcement and help rebuild momentum. Such interleaving of easy material in hard sessions is another form of unpredictable reinforcement that can prevent frustration and reinforce long-term memory through additional retrieval practice.

Technically, implementing adaptive scheduling involves tracking more state per item than just an “ease factor.” Modern approaches treat each item as having a **probabilistic memory state** that changes over time. For example, FSRS tracks for each card a *retrievability (current recall probability)* and *stability (how long it will stay above a certain recall probability)* . While we need not implement full-blown machine learning, the principle is that the scheduling algorithm should use the learner’s ongoing performance to tweak when a card is shown next. Our strategy could keep a rolling measure of each card’s *difficulty* or consistency. If a card’s recall has been inconsistent (e.g. the user remembered it, then forgot next time, then remembered), the algorithm can respond by shortening its interval growth or scheduling it more frequently until consistency improves. In short, **non-linear progression** means an item’s next interval isn’t determined by a fixed formula alone – it’s also influenced by factors like the user’s recent recall pattern, how overdue/early the review was, and a bit of randomness. This adaptive approach ensures that learned material is reinforced in a somewhat unpredictable fashion, making memory more durable against the unexpected.

### Dynamic Interval Adjustment to Memory Performance

Instead of using one-size-fits-all interval multipliers, our strategy allows **customizable and dynamic intervals** that respond to a learner’s fluctuating memory performance. In traditional SM-2, each item carries an *ease factor* that dictates how much the interval grows after a successful review (e.g. ease factor 2.5 means intervals roughly 2.5× longer after each good recall). However, SM-2 adjusts this ease factor only in coarse steps – rating a card “hard” or failing it will decrease the ease by a set amount, and marking it “easy” can slightly increase it . This simplistic approach doesn’t actively *aim* for a target performance; it often leads to “ease drift” where cards settle at an ease that might be too low or high for the user’s actual memory strength . For learners with inconsistent recall, a single ease factor per card might not capture their ups and downs over time.

Our modified algorithm will **dynamically tune intervals** with a goal of maintaining a desired success rate (retention) for each item. In practice, this means if a learner starts forgetting a card more than, say, 15% of the time, the scheduling will automatically tighten (shorter intervals), and if they’re remembering it 100% of the time with ease, the scheduling can loosen (longer intervals). Advanced SRS systems already offer similar customization: for instance, FSRS lets users set a target retention (e.g. 90% or 95%), and the algorithm adjusts the review frequency to meet that goal . Users wanting high retention will get shorter intervals (more reviews), whereas those okay with occasionally forgetting (for a lighter workload) can opt for longer intervals . We can incorporate a simplified version of this by providing a **“strictness” setting** in our app – a user slider or profile option that essentially multiplies or divides all intervals. Under the hood, this could be a global interval modifier or an adjustment to the ease factors. For example, a learner who knows they forget things often might set the app to 80% interval strength, meaning if the algorithm normally sets a 10-day gap it will instead use 8 days. This customization acknowledges personal memory variability.

Beyond a user-controlled setting, the system can also automatically adjust intervals per item. One approach is to compute each item’s *observed recall rate* over recent reviews and nudge its ease factor accordingly. Suppose a card was frequently forgotten at a 14-day interval; even after retraining it, we might cap its next interval at something like 7 days because the data shows the learner struggles beyond a week. Conversely, if a card is always remembered easily, we could allow its ease factor to slowly increase, letting intervals grow faster for that item. This **item-by-item adaptation** prevents issues like “ease factor hell,” where an item’s ease gets stuck at a low value causing needlessly frequent reviews even after the learner has improved on it. Instead of SM-2’s fixed +/-15% adjustments on ease , we modify the ease in smaller, continuous increments towards an optimal value. One idea (inspired by Anki community algorithms) is to adjust ease factors based on target recall rates: for each card, aim for ~90% success; if actual success is lower, bump ease down a bit (so the next interval will be shorter), if success is higher, bump ease up slightly  . Constraints are added to avoid extreme jumps (e.g. change ease by at most ±0.1 at a time) . Over time, each card’s scheduling becomes *tuned* to the learner’s memory for that content.

Furthermore, the strategy allows manual customization of interval steps if needed. For example, some learners might want the first few reviews very soon (say 1 day, 3 days, 7 days) but then a slower expansion. Our app could let advanced users define a **custom base schedule** template – similar to the “2357” method often taught for exam revision (review after 2 days, 3 days, 5 days, 7 days, etc.). While the algorithm will adapt on its own, giving users the ability to tweak initial intervals or overall interval multipliers can be empowering. In Org-Drill (an Emacs SRS plugin), there is a concept of a *“learn factor”* that globally accelerates or decelerates interval growth for all cards . By default it’s 0.5 (matching SuperMemo’s settings), but if a user finds they are failing too often or reviewing too much, they can lower or raise this fraction to adjust the frequency of repetitions . In our implementation, we can present this concept in a user-friendly way (e.g. a “review frequency” knob). Behind the scenes, raising this factor would make intervals grow more slowly (more frequent reviews), and lowering it would make them grow faster (fewer reviews). The impact can be significant: with a slightly higher learn fraction, an item might reach a 1-month interval after, say, 5 successful reviews instead of 7, whereas a very conservative setting might require many more reviews before intervals get that long . By allowing such dynamic interval adjustments – both automated based on performance and configurable by user preference – the system accommodates fluctuating memory strength. It essentially **bends the forgetting curve** to fit the learner, rather than expecting the learner to conform to a fixed curve.

### Automatic Demotion and Re-Drilling of Lapsed Items

A forgiving spaced repetition system must ensure that no item slips through the cracks – if something is forgotten or even shaky, it should promptly return to intensive review. Our strategy features **automatic demotion** of items and targeted re-drilling, even if those items were previously marked as “easy” or had long intervals. Traditional systems already hint at this: the Leitner box method famously sends any card you get wrong all the way back to Box 1 (the most frequent review box) . This guarantees you’ll see that item again soon, effectively “relearning” it from scratch. We adopt a similar philosophy but with a bit more nuance. Rather than always sending a failed item to the very start, our algorithm can adjust the level of demotion based on how strongly it was embedded before the lapse. For instance, if an item was at a 30-day interval and the user fails it, we might demote it to a medium stage (say equivalent to a 3-day interval) rather than full reset, especially if this is the first lapse. However, if the item keeps failing repeatedly (a sign of a “leech”), we will aggressively reset and drill it until it sticks.

**Redrilling** means giving the learner multiple opportunities in a short span to re-cement the memory. In practice, when an item is demoted due to a lapse or very low confidence recall, the app should schedule one or more **immediate repeats** of that item within the same study session. For example, if you just failed a card, you might see it again after 1 minute, then 10 minutes, to ensure you can recall it correctly now (this is similar to Anki’s “relearning steps” for lapsed cards). Our strategy could implement a simple redrill sequence: upon failure, the card enters an *“intensive review queue”* – the app will present it again after a short delay (allowing a bit of forgetting, to make sure learning is happening), and perhaps once more before returning to normal scheduling. These quick successive recalls leverage the **spacing effect even within a single session**, turning one failure into a learning opportunity. Essentially, the item is treated as if it were new, going through a few initial repetitions to rebuild the memory trace.

Importantly, even items that the user marked as “easy” and pushed far into the future are not exempt from potential demotion. If an “easy” item comes up months later and is forgotten, the algorithm should **override any lingering ease factor or long interval** and prioritize that item for frequent review again. In our system, any lapse triggers a recalculation of difficulty: the item’s difficulty rating increases (meaning we consider it harder now) and its future intervals will be shorter until proven otherwise. This prevents the common issue of an item that was once easy becoming a persistent leech because the system was *too* confident in it. We explicitly design for *memory instability* – if the learner’s performance on an item fluctuates, the scheduling contracts to reinforce that item more often.

To visualize how demotion works, consider the Leitner system’s boxes. A correct answer moves a card to a box reviewed less frequently (promoting it), while an incorrect answer sends it back to the first box (demoting it) . In our strategy, we effectively have a similar concept, but it’s embedded in the algorithm rather than literal boxes. An item’s *review interval tier* goes down on failure. We might define tier levels like: Learning (daily), Young (every few days), Mature (weeks or more). A lapse might drop a Mature item back to Young or Learning depending on severity. The **goal is to ensure the item gets the extra practice it needs right away** and then gradually climbs the ladder again. We also implement safeguards for items that chronically cause trouble. If a card has been demoted and relearned multiple times (for example, failed 3+ times), our app can flag it as a **“leech”**. Instead of simply scheduling it yet again, the system could prompt the user to edit the card (maybe the content is confusing or too broad) or provide additional mnemonic hints. After editing or additional study outside the SRS, the card re-enters the review cycle from scratch. This way, the strategy acknowledges when repetition alone isn’t working and a different approach is needed.

In summary, *no card is ever truly safe from demotion.* Even the easiest items will occasionally be tested, and if cracks are found (i.e. the user struggles), the system will automatically bring those items back into frequent rotation. By building this “safety net,” we accommodate learners whose memory of “known” items might unexpectedly lapse. The continuous loop of promotion for success and demotion for failure keeps the review pool fresh and appropriately challenging. This also aligns with the principle of **active recall** – we only consider an item mastered if it can survive multiple spaced tests. If not, it goes right back into training. The strategy’s forgiving nature lies in *how* it handles the lapse: not as a final verdict that the learner failed, but as a normal part of learning where the item simply needs more practice. Automatic demotion and re-drilling ensure that these practices happen promptly and systematically.

*Illustration of the Leitner system’s promotion/demotion concept. Correctly answered cards move to higher-numbered boxes reviewed less often (green arrows), while incorrectly answered cards drop back to Box 1 for frequent review (red arrow) . Our strategy applies a similar idea: any forgotten item is “demoted” to a shorter interval and drilled more often until it’s stable again. This prevents long-term gaps from forming in the learner’s memory.*

### Implementation in a JavaScript App

Designing this strategy into a JavaScript-based flashcard app requires careful planning of the **algorithm and data management**. Below, we outline how to implement the key features:

### Algorithm Adjustments

At the heart of the app is the scheduling algorithm that determines when to show each card. We modify the standard SM-2 algorithm as follows:
	* 	**Review Feedback Scale:** Allow more nuanced feedback than “again/good/easy.” For example, use a 4-point scale: Fail (0), Hard (1), Good (2), Easy (3). This gives more data on user recall quality. Each feedback choice triggers specific logic:
	1.	**Fail (0):** Immediate demotion and redrill. The card’s next review is scheduled very soon (e.g. in 10 minutes or at the end of the current session). Its interval is reset to a small value (like 1 day or less), and its difficulty rating is increased (so future intervals grow slower). We also log a lapse count.
	2.	**Hard (1):** The user barely remembered. We schedule a much shorter interval than last time (maybe 20-50% of the previous interval) to reinforce soon. The card’s difficulty is tweaked up (making future growth slower). If this card was in a high interval tier, we effectively “demote” it one level.
	3.	**Good (2):** The user recalled as expected. We schedule the next review with moderate interval growth. For example, use the current interval multiplied by the card’s ease factor *and* a global modifier. We also apply a bit of random fuzz (e.g. ±10%) to this interval to introduce unpredictability. The ease factor might stay the same or adjust slightly towards an optimal value (see next point).
	4.	**Easy (3):** The user found it very easy. We can afford to stretch the interval more. Increase the ease factor a bit (up to a cap) and multiply the current interval by this higher factor for next review. We still add a small random offset. However, we **do not** simply set the item aside indefinitely – even “easy” items will follow the normal process and get a next review date (albeit far out).
	* 	**Dynamic Ease Factor:** Instead of a fixed ±15% change, we calculate ease factor adjustments based on performance history. For each card, track a running success rate (e.g. last 5 reviews). If the success rate falls below our target (say 85-90%), we decrement the ease factor; if it stays high, we slowly increment it. This is done in small steps so that one good or bad day doesn’t swing it wildly. Over time, each card’s ease factor converges to a value that yields the target recall rate for that card  . For example, a card that the user consistently struggles with will end up with a low ease factor (meaning the algorithm will keep its intervals short), whereas an easy card’s ease factor will rise, allowing faster interval growth. We’ll enforce reasonable bounds (perhaps 130% minimum to 300% maximum, in SM-2 terms) so that no card gets impossibly short or excessively long intervals.
	* 	**Adaptive Interval Calculation:** The next interval is not just lastInterval * easeFactor. We incorporate several modifiers:
	* 	**Recency of Review:** If the card was reviewed late (after it was due), we downscale the next interval slightly because the forgetting curve had more time to act. If it was reviewed early (before it was due, perhaps in a random drill), we might up-scale the next interval a bit or at least not penalize the card for the early review . Essentially, we simulate what SM-5/SM-8 do by adjusting for early/late reviews . In practice, we could multiply the interval by a factor like (actualInterval / scheduledInterval)^(some power) to adjust. For example, if a card was supposed to be reviewed in 5 days but was reviewed in 10 (late), the next interval might be multiplied by, say, 0.8 to account for the extra delay (since the user almost forgot). These calculations ensure the schedule adapts to the user’s actual review timing – helpful for those who can’t review exactly on schedule.
	* 	**Random Noise:** As noted, we add a random ±X% to the computed interval . We can implement this easily with interval *= random(0.95, 1.05) (for ±5% noise, for example). Each card’s next due date is then set to Date.now() + interval (in milliseconds or days). We make sure to do this *after* applying other adjustments so we don’t skew critical corrections (like demotions).
	* 	**Global Retention Goal:** Include a deck-wide or user-wide modifier to hit a target retention. For instance, if the user chose “High Retention” mode, we multiply all intervals by 0.9 (10% reduction, meaning more frequent reviews). This acts like Anki’s “interval modifier” but dynamic – the app could even adjust it periodically by looking at the overall correctness rate of recent reviews. If the user is remembering less than, say, 80%, the app might globally shorten intervals a bit to help, and vice versa  . This provides another safety net for memory fluctuations at the macro level.
	* 	**Scheduling Queue with Re-drills:** We maintain a special short-term queue for re-drills of failed items. When a card gets a “Fail,” we not only schedule it for later, but also push a copy of it into an *active session queue*. For example, the app could schedule the failed card to reappear after 5 cards or after 5 minutes in the same session (whichever comes first). This re-drill queue ensures the user doesn’t leave the session without correcting mistakes. After the user successfully recalls the item in the re-drill (or marks it again accordingly), it can graduate back to the normal review cycle with a new interval. Essentially, each lapse triggers a mini learning session for that card. The algorithm for a fail might be: card.interval = baseInterval (e.g. 1 day); card.easeFactor = max(card.easeFactor - 0.20, 1.3); schedule card for review in 1 day; also schedule an immediate review in session in 10 minutes. This two-pronged scheduling (immediate + next day) mirrors how one would manually cram a forgotten item and then check again later.
	* 	**Leech Handling:** If card.lapseCount exceeds a threshold (say 3 or 4), mark the card as a *leech*. In the algorithm, this could trigger a different action: we suspend it from the normal queue (so it stops showing up), and flag it in the UI as needing attention. The user could get a notification like “This card is giving you trouble. Consider rephrasing the question or mnemonic.” If the app is standalone, it might just keep the card in a suspended state until the user chooses to reintroduce it. This prevents endless frustration with one card. It’s an automatic mechanism to handle items that consistently defy the spaced repetition – often a sign that something about the item’s content or the learner’s understanding needs to change.
	* 	**Data-Driven Refinement:** Over time, as we collect more review data, the app could refine scheduling further. For example, we might notice the user tends to forget certain types of cards (like formula-based questions) more often, so the algorithm could treat those as inherently harder (like lowering their ease factors initially). While this veers into experimental territory, our data model will allow storing metadata (tags, note types) so future improvements or ML models could utilize it. The scheduling function can be built to accommodate plugin-like adjustments – e.g., before finalizing a schedule, run through any custom functions that adjust intervals based on card tags or performance patterns. This keeps the system flexible and able to evolve with the learner’s needs.

Pseudo-code for the core scheduling might look like:

`function scheduleNext(card, feedback) {`
    `const now = Date.now();`
    `if (feedback === 0) {  // Fail`
        `card.lapses += 1;`
        `card.easeFactor = Math.max(card.easeFactor - 0.2, 1.3);`
        `card.interval = card.lapses === 1 ? 1 : Math.max(1, Math.floor(card.interval * 0.5));`
        `card.due = now + card.interval * DAY;  // review tomorrow (interval in days)`
        `enqueueRedrill(card, now + 5 * MINUTE);  // in-session redrill after 5 minutes`
    `}`
    `else {`
        `// Calculate base new interval from last interval and ease`
        `let newInterval = (feedback === 3)`
            `? card.interval * card.easeFactor * 1.3   // Easy: boost by ~30%`
            `: (feedback === 2)`
            `? card.interval * card.easeFactor        // Good: standard growth`
            `: card.interval * card.easeFactor * 0.5; // Hard: shorter than normal`

    `// Adjust for early/late review`
        `const dueDiff = (now - card.lastReview) / DAY / card.interval;  // fraction of interval elapsed`
        `if (dueDiff > 1.2) {        // reviewed much later than scheduled`
            `newInterval *= 0.9;     // reduce next interval by 10%`
        `} else if (dueDiff < 0.8) { // reviewed earlier than scheduled`
            `newInterval *= 1.05;    // slight boost to next interval`
        `}`
        `// Random noise ±5%`
        `newInterval *= (0.95 + Math.random() * 0.10);`

    `// Global retention modifier`
        `newInterval *= retentionFactor;  // e.g., 0.85 for stricter setting, 1.1 for lenient`

    `// Update ease factor for dynamic adjustment`
        `if (feedback === 1) {       // Hard (almost forgot)`
            `card.easeFactor = Math.max(card.easeFactor - 0.05, 1.3);`
        `} else if (feedback === 3) { // Easy`
            `card.easeFactor = Math.min(card.easeFactor + 0.03, 3.0);`
        `} // (If Good, we might leave ease or adjust slightly towards baseline if using target retention logic)`

    `card.interval = Math.ceil(newInterval);`
        `card.due = now + card.interval * DAY;`
    `}`
    `card.lastReview = now;`
    `saveCard(card);`
`}`

The above pseudocode is a simplification, but it shows how various factors (feedback, easeFactor adjustments, early/late timing, randomness, global modifier) come together to decide card.due. In a real app, we’d refine the constants (like 1.3 ease boost for “easy” or the thresholds 1.2/0.8 for dueDiff) through testing. The key is that the algorithm is **stateful per card** – each card object holds its own interval, easeFactor, lapses, due date, etc., which get updated on each review. This allows truly individualized pacing.

### Data Management Considerations

Implementing the above algorithm requires a robust way to store and update card data. In a JavaScript app (likely running in a browser or on a Node backend), we have a few options:
	* 	**Data Schema:** Each flashcard can be represented as an object or record in a database with fields such as:
	* 	id: Unique identifier.
	* 	question / answer: The content.
	* 	**Scheduling fields:** interval (in days or a similar unit), easeFactor (as a decimal, e.g., 2.5), dueDate (timestamp or date when the card is next due), lastReview (timestamp of the last review), lapsCount (number of lapses), reviewHistory (could be a list of recent scores or timestamps).
	* 	**Metadata:** Tags, creation date, etc., which can be useful for filtering or identifying leeches (“math”, “language”, etc., if certain tones consistently have issues).
We will also likely have a separate collection/table for **review logs**: each time a card is reviewed, we append a record: {cardId, timestamp, feedback}. This log is valuable for analytics (e.g., calculating success rate, or if we ever want to visualize the forgetting curve for a card).
	* 	**Storage Technology:** In a browser environment, using **IndexedDB** or a wrapper like Dexie.js would allow us to store large amounts of structured data (much more scalable than localStorage). IndexedDB can store objects for each card and supports indexes (like querying all cards due before a certain time, which is essential for pulling the day’s study queue). If the app is server-backed or uses a local server, a lightweight database (like SQLite or WebSQL if still supported) could work similarly. For simplicity, one could even use an in-memory JS object that is saved to localStorage as JSON after each session – though that would be limited for large decks or multi-device sync.
	* 	**Fetching Due Cards:** Each time the user opens the app or wants to study, we need to gather which cards are due for review. With our unpredictability factor, this isn’t just all cards with dueDate <= now, but we might also include a small fraction of cards not yet due (to serve as “surprise” reviews). For example, we could fetch all due cards normally (say there are 50 due today), and then also randomly select 5-10 cards that are *not* due for X days more, and include them in the session. Those selected early will be marked as reviewed early, and our algorithm will adjust their next interval accordingly. Implementing this involves an IndexedDB query for due cards and another query for a random sample from the remaining pool (or keeping a list of all card IDs and shuffling). We must ensure that early reviewed cards get their dueDate pushed out appropriately to avoid double reviewing.
	* 	**Updating and Persisting Data:** After each review, the app should update the card’s record (interval, ease, due, etc.) and persist it. This can be done transactionally if possible (to avoid data loss on a crash). If using IndexedDB, one would likely use a transaction per review or batch per session. It’s important to handle concurrency if the app might review multiple cards “at once” (though typically it’s sequential). Also, if the app is offline-capable, all this needs to happen client-side, with perhaps sync to a server or cloud when possible. Each card’s lastReview can help resolve conflicts (the latest timestamp wins, for instance, if sync merges decks from two devices).
	* 	**Handling User Configurations:** As we allow custom settings (like retention goal or starting interval steps), these need to be stored (perhaps in a separate settings store keyed by user or deck). The algorithm will read these settings each time it schedules. For example, retentionFactor or similar from pseudocode might come from a user profile that is adjustable via UI. If the user changes settings, we should clarify how it affects existing cards: a straightforward way is to only apply new settings to future scheduling decisions (no need to retroactively recompute all intervals, which could be complex and unnecessary).
	* 	**Monitoring Performance:** To track “memory fluctuations effectively,” our database should make it easy to compute metrics like rolling success rate per card, average review time, etc. The reviewHistory field can store recent outcomes (perhaps compressing older history to save space). Alternatively, we could store an exponential moving average of performance: each card record could maintain successRate and update it with each review (e.g., successRate = 0.8 * successRate + 0.2 * (feedback was success ? 1 : 0)). This would quickly flag cards that are slipping (their successRate drops). We might also track how much the interval was adjusted from the ideal each time, as another indicator of stability.
	* 	**Leech Management:** We mentioned flagging leeches – this could be done by adding a boolean field suspended or active in the card data. If a card is a leech, mark it suspended so that the query for due cards ignores it. The app can then have a section “Leech cards (needs attention)” listing those suspended items for the user to manually intervene. We should also store the reason (e.g., “suspended due to 4 lapses”). Optionally, we can automatically unsuspend after some time or after the user edits it.
	* 	**Scalability and Maintenance:** If the learner has thousands of cards, the system should remain efficient. IndexedDB is quite fast at key-based lookups; ensuring an index on dueDate will allow pulling due items quickly. Bulk operations (like incrementing all intervals by a factor if the user changes retention setting) can be done by iterating or, if needed, by writing a small migration script that adjusts each record. The data format (with explicit fields for interval, ease, etc.) is flexible enough to extend – for instance, if later we incorporate a “stability” field from FSRS, we can add it without breaking existing records (just start computing it for new reviews).
	* 	**Example Data Entry:** A card’s data might look like:

`{`
  `"id": "card123",`
  `"question": "What is the capital of France?",`
  `"answer": "Paris",`
  `"interval": 15,`
  `"easeFactor": 2.3,`
  `"dueDate": "2025-04-10T08:00:00Z",`
  `"lastReview": "2025-03-26T08:00:00Z",`
  `"lapsCount": 1,`
  `"successRate": 0.85,`
  `"history": [`
     `{"date": "2025-03-10", "feedback": 2},`
     `{"date": "2025-03-18", "feedback": 2},`
     `{"date": "2025-03-26", "feedback": 0}`
  `],`
  `"suspended": false,`
  `"tags": ["geography"]`
`}`

This shows a card that had a 15-day interval, with an ease factor around 2.3 (230%). It was due April 10, but the last review on Mar 26 was a failure (feedback 0), which incremented lapsCount. The history confirms two good reviews then a fail. The successRate (~0.85) might be a moving average. The system, seeing the fail, would have demoted the card (interval probably reset to 1 day and dueDate adjusted accordingly after Mar 26 – the example dueDate of Apr 10 might be from before the lapse). This JSON would be stored in IndexedDB. Whenever the app needs to display or schedule the card, it references these fields.

    ***Testing and Tuning:** With the data and algorithm in place, we would test the app with various scenarios: frequent usage, skipping a week of study, a learner always hitting “Hard,” etc. The data logs can be inspected to ensure the algorithm behaves as intended (e.g. does it shorten intervals for cards with many hards? Does it bring back lapsed cards often enough?). Because we keep detailed history, we could even simulate the algorithm on past data to see if the retention goal is being met. Adjustments (like changing the ease factor decrement on fail from 0.2 to 0.15, or the random noise range) can then be applied and the data model updated accordingly.

In implementing all this in JavaScript, it’s crucial to keep the system **maintainable**. We might structure the code with a Scheduler class that has methods like reviewCard(card, feedback) which encapsulates the logic described, and a Database module to handle storing and retrieving card objects. This separation makes it easier to adjust the algorithm without messing up storage, and vice versa.

Finally, from a user experience standpoint, we should communicate these features transparently: for example, show a marker on cards that were auto-demoted (“Relearning”) or indicate approximate next review times so the user isn’t surprised by the algorithm’s choices. A forgiving system should still feel coherent to the learner. By logging and perhaps visualizing their progress (like “This card’s interval went up to 20 days, then dropped to 5 due to a lapse, now back to 12”), the learner can trust the system and even adjust their own habits (maybe they realize they consistently lapse on Fridays, etc., and adapt).

**Conclusion:**
This alternative spaced repetition strategy is tailored for flexibility. By periodically re-drilling old items, adding randomness to review schedules, dynamically adjusting intervals, and automatically demoting items that show weakness, we create a safety net for learners with inconsistent recall patterns. The JavaScript implementation needs to carefully track each item’s state and history, but with a thoughtful schema and algorithm, the app can effectively *personalize* the repetition schedule in real-time. The end result is a system that maintains the memory-optimizing benefits of spaced repetition – leveraging the proven forgetting curve and testing effect – but in a gentler, more responsive manner. Learners can miss a day or have a bad week without derailing the whole system; the algorithm will adapt and recover, keeping their long-term goals on track.   All these modifications make spaced repetition more forgiving, without losing its efficiency, thereby empowering users who need that extra flexibility to still reap the rewards of consistent, reinforced learning.

**Sources:** The design above integrates insights from spaced repetition research and existing tools, including adaptive algorithms like FSRS , practical tweaks from Org-Drill and Anki communities  , and known techniques for maintaining long-term retention  . By combining these ideas, we aim to support learners in a wide range of situations, ensuring that the path to remembering is as smooth (and adjustable) as possible.
