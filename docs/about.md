# Stuff to Know About *Entiendo*

*Entiendo* is gap-filler project. It emphasizes several thing missing from other forms of language learning utilities and institutions. You still need to drill conjugations, memorize vocabulary, understand basic sentence structure, direct object bladdity blahs and there are awesome resources available all over the place to help you do those things. *Entiendo* does what none of those seem to want to cover and yet are essential to being fluent in a language.

> This application focuses on speech common in Rio de la Plata - that is: Buenos Aires and Uruguay. The project source code is freely available for anybody else to adapt it to other languages or dialects of Spanish.

## Idioms

An idiom can be an expression, a phrase or any combination of words that carries a meaning uniquely different as a groups as opposed to when used as individual words. In many cases the idiomatic phrase, or expression, is metaphorical or references some aspect of culture like "raining cats and dogs" or "it's a homerun." In these cases the meaning of the phrase can be deduced from the individual words even if you have never heard the combination used in that way.

However, many idiomatic expression have zero connection to their individual words. There is no possible way to determine the meaning of the phrase unless you happen to know the intent behind it.

Perfectly reasonable definitions for *turn* would mention bending or rotation. Or for *take* it would say something about obtaining and possesion. But add any preposition to those words and suddenly they mean something randomly different:

- **take off** - leave
- **take on** - confront
- **take in** - harbor a guest (and more)
- **take out** - vanquish an opponent
- **take up** - pursue a goal or mission
- **take down** - write something (and others)
- **turn down** - refuse (or make a bed)
- **turn up** - arrive
- **turn in** - go to sleep
- **turn out** - crowd size (or...)

It **turns out** the words *take* and *turn* show up infinitely more idiomatically than as their basic definitions imply. And all of us speak in idioms all day long, like "*show up*" the sentence before this one. And the insideous idioms obscure the basic meaning of their individual words. "You look good," "my phone doesn't work," "it's up to you," "that makes sense," etc. We, English speakers, know what those idioms mean because we know what they mean - not because placing those words together actually, you know, makes sense.

So for all the vocabularly drilling you've been doing you still don't know what people are saying and that's because, for whatever reason, no language school, app, website or resource focuses on the way people actually speak.

Spanish is steeped in idiomatic expressions that obscure whatever you think their words mean. We all learned words like *quedar, llegar, dar, hacer, poner, tener, echar, pasar, llevar, tomar* and *salir* but like *take* and *turn* in English, the vast majority of time these words are used have nothing to do with *leave, arrive, give, make, put*, *have*, etc.

Someone says: "*Sí o sí, ya no queda tiempo*."

Words as fundamental as *sí* or *ya* suddenly means something randomly different than *yes* and *already*.

This is why *Entiendo* has collected hundreds of idioms, ranked them by (roughly) how often they are used and (roughly) categorized them by what context they tend to come up in.

## Memorizing

If you're still reading this then maybe you have learned something about Spanish... but you haven't learned any Spanish.

People don't speak in rules of grammar or etimological logistics. At best, rules explain how words function, they point at why certain phrases work the way they do. None of that, not one bit it, is what you think about when you speak. We're not suggesting rules, patterns and other mnemonic hints are not useful - but in the end you still have to memorize words and phrases and meanings and thought patterns. In languages especially, if you're not memorizing something you're not learning it - you may be learning *about* it, but you're not learning the thing.

Unfortunately most learning methods employed by most language resources are aimed at the "average" abled person. Someone typically young (25 years old or younger) with a basically solid memory that needs some help at first but can be trained to remember lists of items various well-known techniques.

All of this is (to be blunt) abelist. Stop me if you've heard this one:

> All you need to learn a language, is immurse yourself for 30 days where they only speak it.

This is assuming a lot and honestly, it feels pretty crappy to keep hearing this when you've been struggling for years to grasp the basics.

Some of us are below average when it comes to being able to retain lists of information. By way of example: some of us can not retain lyrics to songs we've been listening to for decades.

And by the way, some of us have been alive for way more decades than two. We cal it neuro-not-so-placisity. Our brains literally shrink as we get older.

Most learning apps use some version of *Spaced Repitition*. This is where the algorithm is deciding, based on your performance in exercises, how much space (time) you will need between repitions in order to maximize your chances of learning something. What they all share in common is they all assume once you've learned something, you pretty much got it.

*Entiendo* assumes the opposite. We designed our own method of memorizing called *Strategy for Inconsisent Recall Pattern* (*SIRP*) which assumes that even if you can recall something instantly now, you will not be able to in the future. And that your recall will to go zero (or near zero) with some regularity.

Most recall systems (including *SM-2/Anki*) anchors on your most recent performance. *SIRP* looks deeper at overall performance when deciding the next time to test your memory skills and then assumes the worst.

Sticking to the SIRP calendar may not be a panacea but at least, for some of us, it is not fighting the natural way we learn things.

## Comprehension

You will never learn a language if you don't know what it sounds like.

That maxim about being inmerised
