*Entiendo* is a gap-filler project. It emphasizes several things missing from other forms of language learning utilities and institutions. You still need to drill conjugations, memorize vocabulary, understand basic sentence structure, pronouns, direct object bladdity-blahs, and there are awesome resources available all over the place to help you do those things. *Entiendo* does what none of those seem to want to cover and yet is essential to being fluent in a language.

> This application focuses on speech common in the Rio de la Plata region — that is, Buenos Aires and Uruguay. The project source code is freely available for anybody to adapt to other languages or dialects of Spanish.

## Idioms

An idiom can be an expression, a phrase, or any combination of words that carries a meaning uniquely different as a group, as opposed to when used as individual words. In many cases, the idiomatic phrase or expression is metaphorical or a cultural reference, like "not fully baked" or "it's a home run." In these cases, the meaning of the phrase can be deduced from the individual words, even if you have never heard the combination used in that way.

However, many idiomatic expressions have zero connection to their individual words. There is no possible way to determine the meaning of the phrase, regardless of context, unless you happen to know the intent behind it.

The word *turn* implies bending or rotation. The word *take* says something about obtaining and possession. But add any preposition to those words and suddenly they mean something randomly different:

- **take off** – leave
- **take on** – confront
- **take in** – harbor a guest (and more)
- **take out** – vanquish an opponent
- **take it out** - to unjustly accost ("don't take it out on me")
- **take up** – pursue a goal or mission
- **take down** – write something (and others)
- **turn down** – refuse (or make a bed)
- **turn up** – arrive
- **turn in** – go to sleep, submit
- **turn out** – crowd size (or...)

It **turns out** the words *take* and *turn* show up infinitely more idiomatically than their basic definitions imply. And all of us speak in idioms all day long, like "*show up*" in the sentence before this one.

As mentioned above insidious idioms obscure the basic meaning of their individual words. "You look good," "my phone doesn't work," "it's up to you," "that makes sense," etc. We English speakers know what those idioms mean because we know what they mean — not because placing those words together actually, you know, makes sense.

So for all the vocabulary drilling you've been doing, you still don't know what people are saying, and that's because, for whatever reason, no language school, app, website, or resource focuses on the way people actually speak: idiomatically.

Spanish is steeped in idiomatic expressions that obscure whatever you think the words mean. We all learned words like *quedar, llegar, dar, hacer, poner, tener, pasar, llevar, tomar* and *salir*, but like *take* and *turn* in English, the vast majority of the time these words are used, they have nothing to do with *leave, arrive, give, make, put*, *have*, etc.

Consider: "*Sí o sí, ya no queda tiempo.*"

Words as fundamental as *sí* or *ya* suddenly mean something randomly different than *yes* and *already*.

> Modern AI systems, like the ones this app relies on, understands regional idiomatic usage extraordinarily well which makes an app like this possible. As of this writing (June 2025) Google Translate still thinks *sí o sí* means *yes or yes*. For the record this is how people would say *Like it or not, we're out of time* in Uruguay.

This is why *Entiendo* has hand curated hundreds of idioms, ranked them by (roughly) how often they are used, and (roughly) categorized them by the contexts in which they tend to come up — and focuses entirely on those.

## Memorizing

If you're still reading this, then maybe you have learned something about Spanish... but you haven't learned any Spanish.

People don't speak in rules of grammar or etymological logistics. At best, rules explain how words function; they point to why certain phrases work the way they do. None of that is what you think about when you speak. We're not suggesting learning rules, patterns, and other mnemonic hints are not useful — but in the end, you still have to memorize words and phrases and meanings and thought patterns. In languages especially, if you're not memorizing something, you're not learning it — you may be learning *about* it, but you're not flexing the part of your brain that's for speech. Despite the way it's taught to most of us, language is the opposite of a puzzle to be solved with hints and rules; it's about training the brain to *[not think](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automaticity/)* full stop.

Unfortunately, learning methods employed by most language resources are aimed at the "average" memory abled person. Someone young-ish (say, 25 years old) with a typically solid ability to memorize. They may need some help at first but can be trained to remember lists of items using various well-researched techniques.

Taking all these characteristics for granted is (to be blunt) ableist. Stop me if you've heard this one:

> All you need to do to learn a language is to immerse yourself for 30 days where they only speak that language.

This assumes a lot and, honestly, it feels pretty crappy to keep hearing this when you've immigrated somewhere and have been struggling for years to grasp the basics.

Some of us are atypical when it comes to retaining lists of information. Some of us cannot, for the life of us, remember lyrics to songs we've been listening to for decades.

And by the way, some of us have been alive for way more decades than two. We are dealing with *neuro-not-so-plasticity*. Human brains shrink as we get older - there is less room for new information and it takes longer for it to get there.

#### *Strategy for Inconsistent Recall Pattern* (*SIRP*)

Most learning apps use some version of *Spaced Repetition*. The algorithm decides, based on your performance in exercises, how much space (time) you will need between repetitions in order to maximize your chances of learning something. What they all share in common is they all assume once you've learned something, you pretty much got it.

*Entiendo* assumes the opposite. We designed our own method of memorizing we call *Strategy for Inconsistent Recall Pattern* (*SIRP*), which assumes that even if you can recall something instantly now, you will not be able to in the near future — and that your recall of any given item will go to zero (or near zero) with some regularity.

Most recall systems (including *SM-2/Anki*) anchor on your most recent performance. *SIRP* looks deeper at overall performance when deciding the next time to test your memory skills — and then assumes the worst.

Sticking to the SIRP calendar may not be a panacea, but at least, for some of us, it is not fighting (or ignoring) the natural way we learn things.

## Comprehension

You will never learn a language if you don't know *what it sounds like*.

Millions of people all around the world are learning English. The advantage many of them have is that (for better or worse), culture that comes from the USA, UK, and Australia — like films, TV, music, gaming, technology, et al. — is all based in English, and the sounds of the language get embedded into folks' minds from a very early age.

But none of that will help you if you want to live in Scotland (or for that matter Baltimore, MD). No English app or school will prepare you for that uniquely regional accent, pronunciation, and resyllabification. Yes, even immersion slows down if you haven't been singing along with the Scottish equivalent of Taylor Swift songs for 10 years.

*Entiendo* is an audio-only application. In other words, every example is audio and you are asked to transcribe the audio as you hear it. Of course, you need to practice speaking, and there are many, many resources out there for you to practice your pronunciation and to converse with someone across the globe who you pay to listen to you speak.

But in addition to that, because real-time deep-end immersion is not *necessarily* the best and only method for everyone, *Entiendo* offers the ability to learn how the language sounds by "freezing" the moment. You can play a phrase over and over and over again so you can *learn what the language sounds like* step by step — one idiom at a time - as many times as you need, phasing out the audio repition at the best pace for you.

The audio samples (especially the ones recorded by live, actual humans) are designed to be difficult to understand. They require work to tease apart *what the language sounds like* when spoken in *Rio Platense* style.
