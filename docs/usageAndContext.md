|-------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **10** | **Extremely common, high-frequency expressions.** Used constantly across all registers (e.g. _tener que_, _estar bien_, _dar cuenta_). Found in everyday talk, media, education. |
| **9**  | **Very common, but not automatic.** Used frequently in casual or general speech. Familiar to nearly all native speakers.                       |
| **8**  | **General-use phrases, neutral tone, and common in conversation and writing.** Not slangy, but broadly understood.                             |
| **7**  | **Moderately common.** You’ll hear them regularly but not daily. Known to most, but may require more context or be situational.                |
| **6**  | **Recognizable, but informal or limited to certain groups.** May be casual, idiomatic, or regional without being obscure.                      |
| **5**  | **Known idioms with narrower use, like proverbs or formal sayings** (_al pan pan…_, etc.). Understandable but less used in modern, spontaneous speech. |
| **4**  | **Occasional, less common expressions.** Might appear in scripted dialogue, literature, or old-school idiom books.                             |
| **3**  | **Rare or subcultural.** Recognizable only if you’re familiar with specific groups or styles (e.g., youth slang, niche humor).                 |
| **2**  | **Esoteric, poetic, or highly local.** Probably understood by natives but almost never said aloud unless in character or for effect.           |
| **1**  | **Hyper-obscure.** Possibly literary, old-fashioned, or overheard once in a film. Not practically useful for learners or general use.          |

## Context: Tone Descriptions

- **Casual**  
  Relaxed, conversational language used in informal settings.  
  Common in everyday interactions among friends or peers.  
  May include colloquialisms, contractions, or regionally relaxed forms.  
  Not intended to impress or persuade—just to communicate comfortably.

- **Neutral**  
  No strong emotional charge—neither formal nor slangy.  
  Commonly used in everyday speech across various settings (home, work, school).  
  Not marked by regional or street-specific vocabulary.  
  Functional and widely understandable, not meant to impress or provoke.

- **Street**  
  Gritty, raw, and informal—rooted in everyday street speech.  
  Often includes slang, vulgar language, or aggressive phrasing.  
  May reflect anger, rebellion, or subcultural identity.  
  Feels real and unfiltered but may not be appropriate in many settings.

- **Esoteric**  
  Obscure, insider, or culturally specific expressions.  
  Might be understood only by people familiar with certain local customs or in-groups.  
  Often playful, ironic, or layered in meaning.  
  Not intended for broad comprehension; part of its appeal is in its exclusivity.

- **Official**  
  Formal or semi-formal language suitable for institutions, rules, or serious settings.  
  Often seen in legal, administrative, or ceremonial contexts.  
  Structured, respectful, and designed for clarity and authority.  
  Rarely uses slang or emotional language, focusing instead on precision and formality.
